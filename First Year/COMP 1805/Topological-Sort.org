* Topological Sorting
** When we have partial orders, we can't always compare things in the partial order.
** Suppose you are building a house
*** You can define a partial order based on the "must be done before" relation
*** See 2015-03-24 16.12.20
*** We can possibly define a total order that "respects" this partial order
**** This is similar to a closure
**** We are going to add some relations s.t. the house building relation becomes a total order
**** Definition: A total ordering ≼ is compatible with a partial order R if a ≼ b wherever aRb
*** Observation: Every finite non-empty poset has at least one minimal element.
**** Idea: 
**** - Remove a minimal element and place it at the end of the current total order
**** - Repeat until no more elements.
**** "divides" on {1,2,3,4,6,8,12}
**** The b s.t. has no a such that a divides b = 1
**** Topo: 1
**** set: {2,3,4,6,8,12}
**** The b s.t. has no a such that a divides b = 3
**** Topo: 1,3
**** set: {2,4,6,8,12}
**** The b s.t. has no a such that a divides b = 2
**** Topo: 1,3,2
**** set: {4,6,8,12}
**** The b s.t. has no a such that a divides b = 4 (or 6)
**** Topo: 1,3,2,4
**** set: {6,8,12}
**** The b s.t. has no a such that a divides b = 6 (or 8)
**** Topo: 1,3,2,4,6
**** set: {8,12}
**** The b s.t. has no a such that a divides b = 8 (or 12)
**** Topo: 1,3,2,4,6,8
**** set: {12}
**** The b s.t. has no a such that a divides b = 12
**** Topo: 1,3,2,4,6,8,12
**** set: {}
**** Done!
*** Possible exam q.: Either be given a Hasse diagram or a description, and get a total order out of it
