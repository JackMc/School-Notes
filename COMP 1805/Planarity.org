* Planarity
** Let's say we want to know if a vertex u is connected to vertex v
*** Easy to do. See if it's adjacent!
** We like it when edges don't cross, cause it makes pictures prettier
** Sometimes, it is easy to get confused about a graph when looking at a picture of it because many of the edges cross 
*** Difficult to determine which edge goes where
** It's nicer to look at graphs where the edges *do not* cross.
** ex: k_4 looks like a square with a cross in the middle if you draw it intuitively.
*** This is not "pretty" because the edges cross in the middle.
** There are multiple ways of drawing the same graph
*** We like the drawing that has no crossings in it
** A graph is planar if it can be drawn without edge crossings
*** This doesn't mean that it *is* drawn without edge crossings, this is called a planar representation
** Not all graphs are planar!
*** k_3,3 is not planar
