* Rails Relationships
** TODO Grab talk from ottawaruby website... Didn't catch all the examples.
** A quick overview
** belongs_to
*** Easy way to outsource to another table by foreign ID
*** A heirarchy
** has_many
*** One object has many of another type of object (model)
** has_one
*** Never completely equal
**** One typically holds information about the relationship between the two records
** has_many :through
*** Most typical way to deal with many to many relationships
*** The JOIN table has it's own model (WTF does that mean) (Google what a JOIN table/model is in Rails)
** has_one :through
*** Not really used
*** DOn't forget your join table
** has_and_belongs_to_many
*** Simplest many to many in rails
*** Very simple many-to-many
*** Quick and dirty JOIN relationship
*** Not recommended
** Polymorphic Associations
*** Subtle types of associations exist
**** Accounts has one Person as Customable
**** Accounts has one Corporation as Customable
*** Inheritance/polymorphism for Models?
** Self join
*** Employee has many subordinates
*** Employee belongs to manager
*** Foreign key: manager_id
** Bi-Directional Associations
*** Allows you to easy inverse relationships from other models
